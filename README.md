# Climate-Change-Prediction-using-Timeseries
This project uses time series analysis to predict future climate change. Time series analysis is a statistical method that studies the patterns and trends in data over time. In this project, we used four different time series models: ARIMA, AR, MA and ARMA. We also used machine learning to improve the accuracy of our predictions.
